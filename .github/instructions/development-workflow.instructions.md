# Development Workflow Instructions

## Implementation Planning
- Always create a detailed plan before implementing any changes, functionality, or features
- Present the plan to the developer for approval before proceeding
- Break down complex changes into smaller, reviewable chunks
- Document the reasoning behind architectural decisions and implementation strategies
- Wait for explicit developer approval before starting implementation

## Code Changes & Reviews
- Implement changes step-by-step, allowing for review at each stage
- Clearly explain what each change accomplishes and why it's necessary
- Include testing strategy in the implementation plan
- Propose updates to documentation when adding new features

## Communication Guidelines
- Provide clear, concise explanations for all proposed changes
- Ask for clarification when requirements are unclear rather than making assumptions
- Provide progress updates during longer implementation tasks
- When multiple approaches are possible, present options with pros and cons

## Project Context Awareness
- Consider the overall project direction when proposing changes
- Ensure new code aligns with existing patterns and conventions
- Propose solutions that are maintainable and extensible
- Consider performance implications of suggested implementations

## Emergency Exceptions
- Security-related changes may proceed with explanation but should still be reviewed
- Critical bugs that prevent compilation or basic functionality may be implemented immediately
- Even emergency changes must be thoroughly documented and explained
